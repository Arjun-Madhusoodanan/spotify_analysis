This is a small project I created for analysing my own spotify listening data. You need to have a .env file where you have to add CLIENT_ID="",CLIENT_SECRET="",REDIRECT_URI=""

Set up a spotify developer account and create an app and get the token , client id and secret and set up a redirect uri in that for authentication of your account.
